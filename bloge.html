                <h3>HOW TO BUILD A DESIGN PORTFOLIO WITH ZERO CLIENTS</h3>
                <p>A design portfolio is an excellent way to demonstrate
                     your skills as a freelancer. As a web designer, 
                     you compete with millions of other web designers. 
                     Therefore, you must have a strong portfolio to land a
                      high-paying web designing job in such a competitive 
                      space. A strong portfolio sets you apart from others.
                       Having no clients, however, can make it challenging 
                       to get your portfolio noticed and build up any 
                       momentum.</p>
